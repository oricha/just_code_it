/**
 *Minimum Window Substring
 * Given two strings s and t, return the shortest substring of s such that every character in t, including duplicates, is present in the substring. If such a substring does not exist, return an empty string "".
 *
 * You may assume that the correct output is always unique.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "OUZODYXAZV", t = "XYZ"
 *
 * Output: "YXAZ"
 * Explanation: "YXAZ" is the shortest substring that includes "X", "Y", and "Z" from string t.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "xyz", t = "xyz"
 *
 * Output: "xyz"
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "x", t = "xy"
 *
 * Output: ""
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= t.length <= 1000
 * s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
