/**
 * Diameter of Binary Tree
 * The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes within the tree. The path does not necessarily have to pass through the root.
 *
 * The length of a path between two nodes in a binary tree is the number of edges between the nodes.
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree root, return the diameter of the tree.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5]
 *
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [1,2,3,5] or [5,3,2,4].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [1,2,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
